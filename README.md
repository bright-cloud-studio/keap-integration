# Bright Cloud Studio's Add User Fields
## Adds two custom user fields, "User Image" and "User Bio", which can be added to templates using custom tags. Add into news templates with a dynamic id to display an author's image and bio on posts or put in a static id to display a specific user's image and/or bio anywhere you'd like.
